# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- The premium long-context marker now reads `⚠️ 200k+`: U+26A0 is drawn two
  cells wide by most terminal fonts but counted as one cell (wcwidth 1), so the
  sign overlapped the `2` — and a space alone still lets the next cell clip the
  glyph under a multiplexer such as tmux. The variation selector U+FE0F declares
  the emoji width so the cell count matches the glyph; the space keeps it legible.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-28

### Added
- **Smart zone row.** A `Smart` line above the rate limits shows how much of the
  *smart zone* — the ~120k-token span a model still reasons sharply over, far
  below a 1M advertised window — the session has used. The header keeps saying
  how full the window is; this says how much of it the model reads well. Sized
  via `SMART_ZONE_TOKENS` (`0` hides the row), green below 70% of the zone,
  yellow to the edge, red past it.

### Changed
- The rate-limit rows keep the word `left` on the narrowest tier, so they can't
  be mistaken for the `Smart` row above them, which fills by what's *used*.

### Fixed
- A non-numeric `SMART_ZONE_TOKENS` now prints a dim hint instead of dropping
  the row without a word.
## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-13

### Changed
- **Token cost tracking no longer needs Node.js.** The Today / Yesterday /
  Last 30 Days section previously shelled out to `npx ccusage@latest`, so the
  cost line silently disappeared on machines without Node.js. It now reads
  Claude Code's local transcripts directly and prices them in pure bash + jq —
  the plugin works fully on install with only `jq` (already a dependency).
  - Per-model rates come from [LiteLLM's pricing database](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
    (the same source ccusage uses), fetched once a day via `curl` and cached.
    Offline or without `curl`, a built-in price table keeps the section working.
  - Output matches `ccusage` exactly (validated token-for-token and cent-for-cent
    on Opus/Sonnet/Haiku), and refreshes in ~0.6s instead of ~5s.
  - Covers all current model families including Opus 4.x, Sonnet 5/4.6, Haiku 4.5,
    and Fable/Mythos 5.

### Fixed
- **Errored ccusage cache no longer sticks for 10 minutes.** A failure (e.g.
  `npx not found` before Node is installed) was cached under the same 10-minute
  TTL as a success, so the statusline kept showing the stale error long after
  the cause was fixed. Error results now expire after 1 minute, so installing
  Node — or otherwise resolving the cause — recovers on the next refresh.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Premium long-context marker.** On >200k-window models (e.g. the 1M-context
  Opus), the header shows `⚠200k+` next to the token count once
  `exceeds_200k_tokens` trips — the point where tokens bill at the premium
  long-context rate. Suppressed on standard 200k models, where the existing
  compaction warning already covers "context full".
- **Output-style badge.** A `◑<name>` badge surfaces the active output style
  when it is anything other than `default`, so a behavior-changing style is
  never silently in effect.
- **Agent badge.** A `⛭<name>` badge shows the active agent during `--agent`
  sessions.
- Korean translation of the README ([README.ko.md](README.ko.md)), with
  English ↔ 한국어 language links at the top of both files.

## [1.4.2] — 2026-06-15

### Fixed
- Rate-limit gauges no longer pack their dots together on medium-width terminals.
  The rate-limit lines now compact at their own threshold (~64 cols) instead of
  sharing the header's (~100), and the tight form uses 5 spaced dots — so the
  dots stay legible and evenly spaced at every width.

## [1.4.1] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Responsive layout** — three tiers sized to the terminal width via `$COLUMNS`:
  full (≥132 cols) with context bar, token detail, and burn rate; medium (≥100)
  standard header; compact (<100) minimal header plus tightened rate-limit lines.
- `idle` label on unused rate-limit buckets (0% utilization, `resets_at: null`)
  instead of a blank that read as missing data.

### Changed
- Context gauge is now a lighter 5-dot spaced bar (was 10 packed dots).
- Session name in the header is opt-in (`SHOW_SESSION_NAME`, default off).

### Fixed
- `marketplace.json` version was pinned at `1.0.0`, so `/plugin update` never
  saw a newer release — kept in sync with `plugin.json` now.
- Screenshot shows only buckets that really render (Session/Weekly/Sonnet); the
  fictional Fable/Opus lines and the Opus-only `⚡fast` badge were removed.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Header extras, each toggleable (conf file or env var, conf wins):
  - `SHOW_CONTEXT_BAR` — mini gauge next to ctx %.
  - `SHOW_BURN_RATE` — ~$/hr spend rate (cost ÷ session duration).
  - `SHOW_GIT_AHEAD` — ↑ahead ↓behind vs upstream branch.
  - `SHOW_LINKS` — clickable PR link via OSC 8 (auto-off inside tmux).

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Installers (`install.sh`, `install-remote.sh`) auto-install `jq`/`curl` via the
  detected package manager (brew / apt / dnf / yum / pacman / apk).
- Per-model rate buckets are ordered by capability (Fable > Opus > Sonnet > Haiku),
  with unknown buckets sorted after.
- `scripts/screenshot.sh` — reusable README screenshot generator that renders the
  statusline inside a mock Claude Code UI.

### Fixed
- Every previously-silent failure now surfaces a dim hint (missing `jq`, missing
  `curl`, `npx`/ccusage errors) instead of a blank section.
- Caches moved from shared `/tmp` files to a per-user directory (multi-user
  collision and data-leak fix).

## [1.2.2] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- Show a visible `jq not found` hint instead of going silently blank — common in
  Docker containers after a restart drops the in-container `jq`.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- ccusage section broke under ccusage v18 (removed `--days`, renamed
  `.daily[].date` → `.period`, optional per-agent rows). The cache script now
  handles both the old and new schemas.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Auto-detect per-model weekly rate buckets from the OAuth usage API, so new
  models appear without a script update; `null` buckets are hidden, and an
  `Extra` gauge shows when extra-usage credits are enabled.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- Support for the v2.1.x statusline stdin schema: model badges (⚡ fast mode,
  effort level, ✦ thinking), context token detail (e.g. `143.5K/1M`), PR badge
  with review state, and session lines +/-.

### Fixed
- stdin no longer carries `.git`, so branch and dirty state are read from the
  `git` CLI directly (the branch display had silently stopped working).

## [1.0.0]

### Added
- Initial release: pure-bash Claude Code statusline with context %, rate limits,
  tool/agent activity, and daily/monthly token costs. Plugin marketplace support,
  one-liner installer, and Windows (Git Bash / MSYS2 / WSL) support.
